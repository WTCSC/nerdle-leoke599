# Nerdle ðŸ§®

A fun mathematical twist on Wordle! Instead of guessing words, you need to figure out an 8-character equation like `12+34=46` or `3*34=102`. Put your math skills to the test in this engaging puzzle game.

## Game Features

- **Mathematical Wordle**: Guess equations instead of words
- **8-character format**: All equations will have exactly 8 characters without spaces
- **Smart feedback**: Get hints about correct numbers and positions
- **6 attempts**: You have 6 guesses to solve each puzzle
- **Valid equations only**: Only mathematically correct equations are accepted

## Getting Started

### Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- No external packages needed!

### Quick Start

1. **Download the game:**
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd nerdle-leoke599
```

2. **Run the game:**
```bash
python3 nerdle.py
```

That's it! Start guessing equations and have fun! ðŸŽ¯

## How to Play

ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**: Guess the hidden 8-character mathematical equation

### Game Rules
- You have **6 attempts** to guess the correct equation
- Each equation is exactly **8 characters** long (like `12+34=46` dont include spaces)
- Only valid mathematical equations are accepted
- Only one operator for every equation (`6*5-2=28` will not work)
- After each guess, you'll get feedback on your numbers and their positions

### Example Equations
- `12+34=46` (addition)
- `3*34=102` (multiplication)
- `252/36=7` (division)
- `56-23=33` (subtraction)

### Feedback System
Just like Wordle, you'll get hints after each guess:
- **Green**: Right number in the right position
- **Yellow**: Right number but wrong position  
- **White**: Number not in the equation
